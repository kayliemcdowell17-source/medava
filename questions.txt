Could we have Medicine store the safe temperature ranges for all medicines, and avoid having Thrombolytic print them separately? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

Could it ever make sense for Transporter to know the order in which medicines are sent, or does that always need to be controlled by Pharmacy?

Could send() in Pharmacy be refactored so as not to repeat code for every medicine? Which features of Java might make that easier?

Why does Thrombolytic have its own method to print safe temperatures instead of overriding toString() or using some other mechanism?

How might the design be changed if new transporters have different capabilities, such as refrigeration or controlled substance clearance?

What potential errors or exceptions could occur in a real-world implementation, and how might we handle them safely in code?
